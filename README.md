## Purpose:
This project was created as part of a coding challenge I was given during an interview for the position of Senior Android Developer at a local startup. I later received an offer :)

## Problem Statement:
The goal is to create an app that requests the Google website every 10 seconds and allows to see the requests as a list or as a chart.
You are not being provided mockups for every screen, please use your creativity to create a UI that matches the aspect of those provided.
Use your best judgement to introduce animations where you find appropriate.

## Requirements:
* Ping www.google.com every 10 seconds even when the app is closed.
* Store the response time and timestamp of when the request was made and HTTP response status code. 
* When pressed on one of the requests, expand to see more details.
* Create a screen that allows to scroll through all the requests.
* Create another screen that allows to see the requests in an interactive line chart for at least the last hour.
* Develop at least 3 of the bonus tasks:
  * Log also all the response headers and information related with the type of connection and battery level.
  * Create a mechanism to allow to jump to a specific date and time.
  * Auto refresh without needing to reload the activity.
  * Filter by successful or failed requests.
  * Allow to click on a point on the chart to see the detail for that request.
  * Display all the requests in the chart.
